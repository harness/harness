# Cargo Tests

This directory contains tests for the Cargo package manager.

## Overview

The tests in this directory are designed to ensure that the Cargo package manager is functioning correctly. They cover a range of scenarios, including:

- Package installation and uninstallation
- Dependency resolution
- Package versioning
- Package metadata

## Test Structure

The tests are organized into several subdirectories, each of which contains tests for a specific aspect of the Cargo package manager.

- `installation`: Tests for package installation and uninstallation.
- `dependencies`: Tests for dependency resolution.
- `versioning`: Tests for package versioning.
- `metadata`: Tests for package metadata.

## Test Files

Each test file is named according to the following convention:

- `test_<test_name>.rs`: A test file for a specific test case.

For example, `test_installation.rs` contains tests for package installation.

## Test Functions

Each test function is named according to the following convention:

- `test_<test_name>`: A test function for a specific test case.

For example, `test_install_package` is a test function for testing package installation.

## Assertions

The tests use the `assert!` macro to verify that the expected behavior occurs. If the expected behavior does not occur, the test will fail and an error message will be displayed.

## Dependencies

The tests depend on the following crates:

- `cargo`: The Cargo package manager.
- `test`: A testing framework for Rust.
