  title: Issue Tracker API
  description: |
    This application implements a very simple issue tracker.
    It's implemented as an API which is described by this swagger spec document.

    The go-swagger project uses this specification to test the code generation.
    This document contains all possible values for a swagger definition.
    This means that it exercises the framework relatively well.
