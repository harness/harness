/*Package restapi Issue Tracker API

This application implements a very simple issue tracker.
It's implemented as an API which is described by this swagger spec document.

The go-swagger project uses this specification to test the code generation.
This document contains all possible values for a swagger definition.
This means that it exercises the framework relatively well.
