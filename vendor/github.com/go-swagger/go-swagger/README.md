Development of this toolkit is sponsored by VMware:  
[![VMWare](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/473334?v=3&s=200)](https://vmware.github.io)  

There is a code coverage report available in the artifacts section of a build. Unfortunately using coveralls made the
build unstable.

Contains an implementation of Swagger 2.0. It knows how to serialize and deserialize swagger specifications.

Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.  
With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment.

With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs.

Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs. Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.

### Binary distribution

go-swagger is distributed as binaries that are built of signed tags. It is published as github release, rpm, deb and docker image.

##### Docker image

```shell
docker pull quay.io/goswagger/swagger
```

##### Static binary

You can download a binary for your platform from github:

https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/latest

```shell
latestv=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
curl -o /usr/local/bin/swagger -L'#' https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/releases/download/$latestv/swagger_$(echo `uname`|tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/swagger
```

##### Debian packages [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/go-swagger/goswagger-debian/swagger/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/go-swagger/goswagger-debian/swagger/_latestVersion)

This repo will work for any debian, the only file it contains gets copied to /usr/bin

```shell
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/go-swagger/goswagger-debian ubuntu main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

##### RPM packages [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/go-swagger/goswagger-rpm/swagger/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/go-swagger/goswagger-rpm/swagger/_latestVersion)

This repo should work on any distro that wants rpm packages, the only file it contains gets copied to /usr/bin/

```shell
wget https://bintray.com/go-swagger/goswagger-rpm/rpm -O bintray-go-swagger-goswagger-rpm.repo
```

### From source

Install or update from source:

```
go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger
```

The implementation also provides a number of command line tools to help working with swagger.

Currently there is a [spec validator tool](http://goswagger.io/usage/validate/):

```
swagger validate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json
```

To generate a server for a swagger spec document:

```
swagger generate server [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]
```

To generate a [client for a swagger spec](http://goswagger.io/generate/client/) document:

```
swagger generate client [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]
```

To generate a [swagger spec document for a go application](http://goswagger.io/generate/spec/):

```
swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json
```

Licensing
---------

The toolkit itself is licensed as Apache Software License 2.0. Just like swagger, this does not cover code generated by
the toolkit. That code is entirely yours to license however you see fit.
